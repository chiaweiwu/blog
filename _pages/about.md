<h4>Who's C?</h4>

<p>I am a front-end developer and a UI/UX designer currently based in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>

<p>Commonly referred to by friends and colleagues as <strong>Lily</strong>, I am passionate about weaving pixel-perfect visuals and clean code together to turn them into practical solutions.</p>

<p class="mb-5"> When I am not coding or designing, you can usually find me shooting portrait photography, diving into another new JavaScript framework just for fun or walking around with a cup of tea on a sunny day.</p>
