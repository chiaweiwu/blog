短篇 React 學習筆記。

## Component Lifecycle

In each component, React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its 3 main phases.

#### ComponentWillMount()

- Called <strong>once</strong> in its component's lifecycle
- Called <strong>before</strong> component render()
- <span class="highlight-text">Avoid any asynchronous behavior in this method</span>
- <span class="highlight-text">setState won't cause a re-render</span>

#### ComponentDidMount()

- Called <strong>after</strong> component render() once
- Async function can be called here
- <span class="highlight-text">Call setState here for re-render</span>

#### ComponentWillUnmount()

- Called <strong>right before</strong> component is removed from the DOM
- Performs cleanups here. (i.e. cancel network call)

#### ComponentWillUpdate()

- Lets you manipulate component just before receiving new state/props.

#### ComponentDidUpdate()

- Called <strong>after</strong> any rendered HTML has finished loading.
