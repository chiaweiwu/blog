## About Components

Core building blocks of React.

<span class="highlight-text">Multiple individual components forms a parent component.</span>

2 types of components in React:
- Functional 
- Class

> Before React Hooks were introduced, functional components were generally used for style (aka the dumb/stateless/presentational component) and class components were used for logic (smart component/stateful/container components). This practice has since been deprecated.

## Functional Components

<span class="highlight-text">After React Hooks are introduced, functional components are used to store state using react hooks.</span>

Like the name implies, think of functional component as a function.

Example:
````
function Welcome(props) {
return <h1>Hello, {props.name} </h1>;
}
````

````
const element = <Welcome name="Boop" />
````

![functionalComp]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/study-series/fn.jpg)


<span class="highlight-text">Props should never be modified!</span>

#### When should you use functional components?

<strong>For React < 16.8...</strong>
- When your comp. simply receive props, doesn't have a state and renders smth (dumb/stateless/presentational comp.)

<strong>For React > 16.8... (React Hooks were introduced)</strong>
- Func. comp. can now have its own state via React Hooks
- Preferred over class comp. bc of React Hooks now.


## Class Components

<span class="highlight-text">Class components were preferred before React Hooks were introduced.</span>

Basically ES6 classes.

Similar to functional component, class comp. optionally receives props as input and renders JSX.

Class comp. can also maintain private internal state of a particular comp.

Example:
````
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name} </h1>;
  }
}
````

<p><span class="highlight-text">Comp. should always start with capital letter.</span><br />
<span class="highlight-text">Again, props should never be modified!</span></p>

#### Drawbacks

- Class comp. is slower than fun. comp in terms of performance. This difference increases as the number of comp in the app increases.
- Slightly inefficient to use bc it requires more coding.
