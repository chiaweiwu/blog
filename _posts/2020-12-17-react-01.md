## Intro to React

React = JS library for building user interfaces or UI components.

#### Features

1. JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension
2. Virtual DOM
3. One way data binding
4. Extensions
5. Debugging

#### Advantages & Limitations

<strong>Virtual DOM</strong>: React uses virtual DOM which is a JS object. This will improve apps performance, since JS virtual DOM is faster than regular DOM. 
<strong>Usability</strong>:React can be used on client and server sides as well as with other frameworks (i.e. NativeScript).
<strong>Maintenance</strong>:Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.

But React covers only the view part of the app. So to complete the entire development we would have to choose other technologies.
