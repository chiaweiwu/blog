短篇 React 學習筆記。

## State

<span class="highlight-text">What is State</span>

Object that holds information that might change over the lifetime of the component.

Used to track data from form input, dynamic data and API.

Example - Local State:

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
````
class Welcome extends React.component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Boop';
    }
  }
}
````

<span class="highlight-text">We assign the initial state in the <strong>constructor</strong>.</span>

<strong>Reading State:</strong>
````
console.log(this.state.name);
````

<strong>Updating State:</strong>

````
// wrong
this.state.name = 'Foo';

// correct
this.setState({name: 'Foo'});
````

<span class="highlight-text">We need to <strong>replace</strong> the entire state object.</span>


#### Updating State

State updates may be asynchronous and are merged.

Take a look:

````
this.state = {
  count: 0;
}

this.setState({count: count + 1}); // count: 1
this.setState({count: count + 1}); // count: 1
````

It should give you 2 right?
<strong>No</strong>

Both the setState count here is enqueued when its value is 0.

<strong>So what do we do if we want to access previous state?</strong>

We pass a function in setState that takes the previous state and updates it in a synchronous manner.

Like this:


````
this.state = {
  count: 0;
}

this.setState(
  (prevState) => {
    return {
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }
  }
);

// count: 1

this.setState(
  (prevState) => {
    return {
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }
  }
);

// count: 2
````

#### useState Hooks (React 16.8)
**To be further discussed in details in a separate post

![useStateHooksFn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/study-series/useStateFn.jpg)

Example code with functional component:
````
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function Welcome () {
  const [count, useCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      Counter: { count } <br />
      <button onClick={()=> useCount( count + 1 )}>
      Add Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}
````

<strong>Note:</strong>
<span class="highlight-text">Hooks aren't supported in class comp.</span>
