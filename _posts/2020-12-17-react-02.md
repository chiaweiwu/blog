短篇 React 學習筆記。

## ES6 for React

JavaScript = a "dialect" of ECMAScript 

ES6 = ECMAScript 2015 = JavaScript standard.

React uses ES6. ES6 is also getting popularity for writing server applications and services via Node.js.

#### Variables

In ES6, variables are declared using <span class="highlight-text">const, let and var</span> keywords.

We cannot redeclare <strong>const</strong> or <strong>let</strong> variables.

And, we can only reassign <strong>let</strong> variable.


#### Block Scope vs Function Scope

<span class="highlight-text">var</span> is function scoped. It can be accessed everywhere.

<span class="highlight-text">let</span> is a block scoped. It can only be accessed inside the block where it is defined.


#### New Update: Arrow Function & Regular Function

Regular Function

````
var hello = function(name) { 
  return name
}
````

ES6 Arrow function

````
let hello = (name) => { return name }
````

Even more ways to define arrow functions...

We can omit {}, if there's only one expression
````
let hello = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
````

We can omit (), if there's only one argument
````
let hello = name => name;
````

We can use _, if there's no argument
````
let hello = _ => 1 + 2;
````

#### this keyword

In regular function, the <strong>this</strong> keyword represents the object called inside a function.

In arrow function, the <strong>this</strong> keyword represents the object that defined the function, which is the window. object.

#### Template Literals

Quoted between ``, string literals that can include expressions. Like this...

````
let name = 'Boop';
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
````

#### Destructuring: Arrays

````
let array = [1,2,3,4,5];
let [value1,value2,value3] = array;
````
this is equivalent to

````
let array = [1,2,3,4,5];
let value1 = array[0];
let value2 = array[1];
let value3 = array[2];
````

#### Destructuring: Objects

Similar to destructuring array...

````
let obj = {
  key1: 'boop',
  key2: 'foo',
  key3: 'bar'
};
let [key1,key2,key3] = obj;
````

#### Spread Operator

The spread operator spreads the values in an iterable, such as array & strings, across arguments or elements.

````
let fruits = ['apples','bananas','strawberry'];
let veggies = ['cabbage','asparagus','green onions'];

let grocery = [...fruits,...veggies];
console.log(grocery);
// ['apples','bananas','strawberry','cabbage','asparagus','green onions']
````

Spread operator can also be used to clone an array & objects in an arrow function.

````
const dog1 = {
  name: 'Boop',
  breed: 'Corgi'
}

const dog2 = {...dog1}
````

#### Rest Parameter

This is used to pass an arbitrary number of argument, and to process these args within the arrow function.

<span class="highlight-text">Rest parameters are array instances.</span>

We use rest parameters if we need extra parameters other than the specified ones.

````
let foo = function(a, b, ...args) {
  console.log(args);
}

foo(1,2); // [], nothing will print inside the array, because we don't have extra parameters

foo(1,2,3,4,5) // [3,4,5]
````

<span class="highlight-text">Difference between rest parameter and normal arguments</span>

Rest parameters returns an <span class="highlight-text">array</span> by default, so methods like <strong>map, sort, shift, forEach...</strong> can be used directly. But for normal args, they need to be converted into an array because normal args are <span class="highlight-text">objects</span>.
