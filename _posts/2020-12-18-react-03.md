短篇 React 學習筆記。

## JSX

JSX = JavaScript Syntax Extension

Lets XML/HTML + JavaScript/React code coexist.

Example:

```
const name = 'Boop';
const element = '<div>Hello, {name}</div>';


ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example, the variable <strong>name</strong> is wrapped in JSX.

<span class="highlight-text">These code are then converted into standard JavaScript objects that can be parsed by the JS Engine.</span>


#### Why JSX?

- Much faster than normal JS, as JSX optimizes when it's converted into regular JS.
- Easy to create template.
- React Component lets us keep both markup and logic together in one file using JSX.


#### Attributes in JSX

React DOM uses camelCase.

For example, class becomes className...
````
let button = <button className="btn-primary">Button</button>;
````
